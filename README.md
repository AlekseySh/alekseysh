## Hi there, I'm Aleksei Shabanov aka @Bender! 👋

I was graduated as master in applied math and physics 🎓 which helped me to start my DS path in 2016 as data analyst for transactions on the stock exchange 💸. In the next several years I tasted different stuff like:
* NLP 📖
* computer vision 📹 
* tabular data 💾 
* infrastructure things 🔧
* competitions 🚴
* writing posts 📝
and so on. 

After this "breadth-first search" I decided to dive deeper into computer vision topics. In particular, after having several projects related to metric learning I made the corresponding open-source contribution and started doing some scientific research 📐. 


### Some highlights:

* I'm one of the most active developers of [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) (it's analogue of PyTorch Lightning). My contribution is in creating a module for triplets based training and futher retrieval like validation, [link](https://medium.com/pytorch/metric-learning-with-catalyst-8c8337dfab1a).
* 2-nd place in Uber's competition about predicting road accidents, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/uber_competition)
* top 1.5% in Facebook AI Image Similarity Challenge, [link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/79/competition-image-similarity-1-dev/leaderboard/) 
* NLP tutorial about Hierarchical Attention Network for sentiment classification, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/ml-recipe-hier-attention)
* public lecture about person Re-Identification task, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8qtBYeOSKE)
