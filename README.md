## I'm Aleksei Shabanov

I had graduated as master in applied math and physics which helped me to start my DS path in 2016 as data analyst for transactions on the stock exchange. In the next several years I tasted different stuff like working with NLP, tabular data, computer vision; doing some infrastructure things; participating in competitions; writing posts and so on. 

After this "breadth-first search" I decided to dive deep into computer vision topics. TODO
