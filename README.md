## Hi there, I'm Aleksei Shabanov aka @Bender! ðŸ‘‹

I was graduated as master in Applied math & Physics, which helped me to start my DS path in 2016. Despite my expierence in NLP and tabular data, I mostly focus on Computer Vision. **Now I am leading a computer vision team working on representation learning for fashion items.**


### Some highlights:
* **I'm the author of [OpenMetricLearning](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning).** OML is a PyTorch-based framework to train and validate the models producing high-quality embeddings.
* I'm one of the most active developers of [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) (it's analogue of PyTorch Lightning). My contribution is in creating a module for metric learning, [link](https://medium.com/pytorch/metric-learning-with-catalyst-8c8337dfab1a).
* 2-nd place in Uber's competition about predicting road accidents, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/uber_competition)
* Top 1.5% in Facebook AI Image Similarity Challenge, [link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/79/competition-image-similarity-1-dev/leaderboard/) 
* NLP tutorial about Hierarchical Attention Network for sentiment classification, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/ml-recipe-hier-attention)
* Public lecture about person Re-Identification task, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8qtBYeOSKE)
