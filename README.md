## I'm Aleksei Shabanov

I was graduated as master in applied math and physics which helped me to start my DS path in 2016 as data analyst for transactions on the stock exchange. In the next several years I tasted different stuff like working with NLP, tabular data, computer vision; doing some infrastructure things; participating in competitions; writing posts and so on. 

After this "breadth-first search" I decided to dive deep into computer vision topics. In particular, after having several projects related to metric learning I made an open-source contribution 




### Some highlights:

* I'm one of the most active developers of [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) (it's analogue of PyTorch Lightning). My contribution is in creating a module for triplets based training and futher retrieval like validation, [link](https://medium.com/pytorch/metric-learning-with-catalyst-8c8337dfab1a).
* 2-nd place in Uber's competition about predicting road accidents, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/uber_competition)
* top 1.5% in Facebook AI Image Similarity Challenge, [link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/79/competition-image-similarity-1-dev/leaderboard/) 
* NLP tutorial about Hierarchical Attention Network for sentiment classification, [link](https://github.com/AlekseySh/ml-recipe-hier-attention)
* public lecture about Re-Identification task, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8qtBYeOSKE)
